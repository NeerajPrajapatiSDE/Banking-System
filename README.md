# Banking System
The code you provided is an implementation of a banking system using Python. It consists of a menu-driven interface that allows users to perform various banking operations. Let's break down the code and provide a description of its functionality:

1. The code begins by importing two modules, `mymodule` and `Functions`. These modules contain the necessary functions and classes to perform the banking operations.

2. A loop is initiated, running for 100 Users in a day, which serves as the main interface for the banking system.

3. Within each iteration of the loop, a menu is displayed to the user, presenting several banking options.

4. The user is prompted to enter a choice from the menu. The code attempts to convert the input into an integer. If the conversion fails, an error message is displayed, requesting the user to enter an integer.

5. Depending on the user's choice, the code branches into different sections, each corresponding to a specific banking operation.

6. Option 1: New Bank Account for Open
   - The user is prompted to enter a customer ID.
   - The code attempts to convert the input into an integer.
   - If successful, the `to_open_account` function from the `Functions` module is called, passing the customer ID as an argument.
   - The result of the function call is printed, and an instance of the `Bank` class from the `mymodule` module is created using the customer ID.
   - The `display` method of the `Bank` class is called to show the account details.

7. Option 2: Apply for a Debit Card
   - The user is prompted to enter a customer ID.
   - The code attempts to convert the input into an integer.
   - If successful, the `check_customer` function from the `mymodule` module is called to check if the customer exists.
   - If the customer exists, the `debit_card` function from the `Functions` module is called to apply for a debit card.
   - A success message is displayed if the application is successful. Otherwise, a message indicating that the customer was not found is shown.

8. Option 3: ATM Machine
   - The user is prompted to enter a customer ID.
   - The code attempts to convert the input into an integer.
   - If successful, the `check_customer` function from the `mymodule` module is called to check if the customer exists.
   - If the customer exists, an instance of the `BankAtm` class from the `mymodule` module is created using the customer ID.
   - The `Atm_machine` method of the `BankAtm` class is called to simulate the ATM machine's functionality.

9. Option 4: Deposit Balance
   - The user is prompted to enter a customer ID.
   - The code attempts to convert the input into an integer.
   - If successful, the `check_customer` function from the `mymodule` module is called to check if the customer exists.
   - If the customer exists, the user is prompted to enter an amount to deposit.
   - The `BankAtm` class is instantiated using the customer ID.
   - The `deposite_balance` method of the `BankAtm` class is called to deposit the specified amount.

10. Option 5: Update Customer Details
    - The user is prompted to enter a customer ID.
    - The code attempts to convert the input into an integer.
    - If successful, the `check_customer` function from the `mymodule` module is called to check if the customer exists.
    - If the customer exists, the `update_customer` function from the `Functions` module is called to update the customer's details.



11. Option 6: Show Customer Details
    - The user is prompted to enter a customer ID.
    - The code attempts to convert the input into an integer.
    - If successful, the `check_customer` function from the `mymodule` module is called to check if the customer exists.
    - If the customer exists, an instance of the `BankAtm` class is created using the customer ID.
    - The `display` method of the `BankAtm` class is called to show the customer's details.

12. Option 7: Check Customer Balance and ATM Pin
    - The user is prompted to enter a customer ID.
    - The code attempts to convert the input into an integer.
    - If successful, the `check_customer` function from the `mymodule` module is called to check if the customer exists.
    - If the customer exists, an instance of the `BankAtm` class is created using the customer ID.
    - The customer's information, including their name, account number, balance, and ATM pin, is retrieved and displayed.

13. Option 8: Quit
    - The code exits the program.

14. If the user enters an invalid option, an error message is displayed.

Overall, the code provides a basic banking system interface where users can perform operations such as opening accounts, applying for debit cards, using an ATM machine, depositing balance, updating customer details, and viewing customer information. However, the actual implementation and functionality of the functions and classes in the `mymodule` and `Functions` modules are not provided, so the specific details and behavior of those operations cannot be determined from the code snippet.
